# Kian and Luke Arnold, Housing Price Prediction With Classical and Neural
Network Linear Regression Models

### Repository Structure
The repository consists of two different jupyter notebook files, one to deal with classic multivariate regression, and one to handle deep learning neural network linear regression. 
Both of these models are to be executed top down.

### Dependencies
The code avaliable in the two notebook files requires
   *   Pandas
   *   Numpy
   *   Tensorflow
   *   Sklearn
   *   Scipi
   *   Seaborn
All of these dependencies can be installed with a simple pip instillation, requiring no path configuration.
